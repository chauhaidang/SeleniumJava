    /**
     * Wrapper classes are classes which wrap primitives data type variables like int, bool, double, etc.
     * The purpose of wrapper class is to help us use some methods support of the wrapper class
     * for example we have int a = 1; -> it just a variable type int. But we can treat this variable like object by using:
     * Wrapper Integer :  Integer a = 1; -> then a will behave as an object and we can access any support methods from Object class
     * and Integer class
     *
     * Another purpose is Collection API does not allow to storage simple primitves type but its object
     * Example:
     * ArrayList<int> -> incorrect
     * ArrayList<Integar> -> correct
     * => that's why we need wrapper class
     *
